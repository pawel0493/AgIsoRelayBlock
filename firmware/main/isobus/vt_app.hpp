// the Working Set / Data Mask / Soft Key Mask object pool from

// broadcast has been seen -- see isobus_virtual_terminal_client.cpp's

// build is actually flashed and running" visible on the VT screen, not
// just in a serial log), every relay's fill, every DI interlock's fill +
// "!" label marker, and the Momentary Override Safety checkbox. Call once
// right after is_connected() transitions to true. Necessary, not just
// nice-to-have: a fresh connection means a fresh object pool upload,
// which resets every fill/label to the static pool's built-in defaults,
// but none of our own state (relay outputs, DI status, the override
// checkbox) resets on a reconnect -- only on an actual firmware reboot --
// so without this, a VT-side hiccup and reconnect would leave the screen
// showing all-off/unchecked while the real state underneath disagreed.

// (never bypasses it; that's reserved for the momentary override path,
