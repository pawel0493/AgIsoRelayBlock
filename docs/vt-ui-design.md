# Virtual Terminal UI Design

Concrete object pool design for the main and channel-name configuration VT
screens: 8 relay-state indicators (4-per-row × 2 rows), three Soft Key Mask
pages for relay control/settings, one configuration Data Mask, and 17
matching AUX-N functions (a toggle + a momentary-override variant per relay
channel, plus one momentary buzzer function). This refines
the general VT/AUX-N notes in
[isobus-protocol.md](isobus-protocol.md) into an actual layout. Channel-name
configuration is implemented; icon picking and a general automation rule UI
remain future work.

Status: VT screen + SKM and AUX-N control are **implemented and
bench-verified**; channel-name configuration is implemented, pending
bench verification. End-to-end AUX-N assignment testing still needs real
joystick hardware access. See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) and
[firmware/tools/gen_object_pool.py](../firmware/tools/gen_object_pool.py)
for the actual generator. No bitmaps have been drawn yet — text labels are
used in their place for now.

## Object pool overview

- **Working Set** object (root of our pool).
- **Data Mask "Main"** — the primary mask:
  - Title/identification text (device name).
  - The relay indicator grid (below).
  - Soft Key Mask assigned: **"Main SKM"** (below) — a second SKM page
    exists too, reached at runtime via a next/back key pair, not through
    the Data Mask's own static assignment (see
    [Soft Key Masks](#soft-key-masks-two-pages-reached-via-a-nextback-key)
    below).
- A separate channel-name configuration mask is also included below. Icon
  picking and general automation rules remain future work; see
  [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

## Relay indicator grid (on the Data Mask)

Eight identical widgets, 4 per row × 2 rows (R1–R4 top, R5–R8 bottom), one
per relay channel. First pass used a single row of small 32×32 boxes with
8×8 text and turned out to be barely readable on the bench — bumped up and
reflowed into a grid. Each widget:

- An **Output Rectangle**, 60×60, always outline-drawn (works even on a
  monochrome VT where colour can't be relied on).
  - **OFF:** unfilled / white.
  - **ON:** solid fill (black, or the VT's "active/highlight" colour where
    available) — state is shown by fill, not by hue, so it still reads
    correctly on 2-colour and colour-blind-unfriendly displays.
- An **Output String** with the configured channel name, directly under the
  rectangle (not inside it: white-on-black would be fine, but a solid
  black ON fill would swallow black text drawn on top of it, so it stays
  below where it's readable in both states).
- Optional (nice-to-have, not required for MVP): make the widget a
  **Button** object so a touchscreen VT can also toggle it by tapping —
  the real toggle path for non-touch VTs is the SKM/AUX-N below, so this
  is an enhancement, not a dependency.

## Digital input indicators & limit-switch interlock

Phase 6's first automation rule (see
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md#phase-6--automation-rules)): digital input DI{n}
is a fixed, hardcoded limit-switch interlock for relay channel {n}. Two
small additions to each channel's widget in the relay indicator grid make
this visible and testable from the VT, without any new fonts, strings, or
bitmap graphics:

- A small (20×20) **Output Rectangle** under the configured channel label, unfilled =
  DI inactive, filled = DI active — the same fill-by-state convention as
  the main 60×60 relay indicator, just smaller and with no label of its
  own (its position, directly below the matching channel, already says
  what it is). Cheap: a rectangle + a dedicated `FillAttributes` object
  per channel, ~336 bytes total for all 8 — deliberately avoided anything
  graphics-based here, both for the effort and to keep the pool free of
  bitmap data until icon picking is implemented.
- The channel's own configured name gets a **`!` suffix** while its DI is
  active (`"Start!"` instead of `"Start"`, via `send_change_string_value` — no
  new objects needed, just a runtime value change on the string that's
  already there), so it's obvious at a glance *why* a channel won't
  respond, without having to notice the smaller DI box.

While DI{n} is active: channel {n} is forced off immediately (if it was
on) and refuses to be turned back on by any control path (SKM toggle,
AUX-N toggle) except the momentary override path, which can bypass it if
the operator has deliberately enabled that (see below) — enforced in one
place, `vt_app.cpp`'s `apply_relay_state`, so every control path is
protected without having to duplicate the check. When DI{n} goes inactive
again, the channel stays off; the operator has to explicitly command it
on again, matching this project's "safe defaults" requirement (N4) — a
limit switch releasing shouldn't by itself resume motion.

**Bench-confirmed real use case**: a hydraulic cylinder's end-stop switch
wired to DI3, pulled to DGND when the cylinder reaches full travel (see
[hardware.md](hardware.md#open-questions) for why DGND, not COM, is the
"active" side of a DI channel). Reaching the end stop drives DI3 active,
which the VT immediately shows as `"R3!"` with its DI box filled, and
channel 3's output is force-disabled — stopping further movement in that
direction without needing any external limit-switch relay or interposing
logic, and without the operator having to notice anything except the "!"
on the screen.

## "Momentary Override Safety" checkbox

A single, device-wide checkbox (unfilled/unchecked by default) on the
Data Mask, below the relay grid, toggled by SK2 on SKM page 3 (terse "OR"
label — see `gen_object_pool.py`'s comment for why, and why it lives on
page 3 alongside the WiFi panel below rather than page 2's per-channel
momentary keys; the full name is the label printed next to the checkbox
itself).

**Motivating example**: an auto-mode drives a hydraulic cylinder (e.g. a
rear door) and normally stops it at a DI-triggered limit partway through
its travel — not a hard end-stop, a deliberate soft limit for the normal
case. Occasionally the operator needs to push past that limit on purpose
(the door needs to open further than usual, just this once). With the
checkbox **unchecked** (default): pressing the momentary AUX-N/SKM button
past the limit does nothing, same as any other control path — the
interlock wins. With it **checked**: that one momentary button is allowed
to turn the channel back on despite the limit being active, for as long
as it's held, so the operator can nudge the actuator further — while the
plain toggle paths (SK1–SK8, the AUX-N latch variant) still always refuse
regardless of this checkbox, so a stray/accidental toggle press can never
be the thing that bypasses a safety limit; only a deliberate hold of the
momentary control can.

**Deliberately never persisted across a reboot** (`g_momentary_override_safety_enabled`
in `vt_app.cpp` is a plain in-memory `bool`, not written to NVS): if this
state survived a power cycle, the machine could start up with a safety
limit silently bypassed with no operator action having happened that
session — checking whether it's still checked isn't something an operator
reliably remembers to do after every restart. Always boots (and every
fresh VT connection re-syncs the checkbox visual to, via
`resync_display()`) to unchecked/safe; enabling the override is a
deliberate per-session choice. Relay outputs follow the same
never-persisted, always-off-at-boot rule (`io::relay_driver::init()`, N4)
for the same reason.

## WiFi status & control panel

Below the override checkbox, also on the shared Data Mask (visible
regardless of which SKM page is active) — mirrors `net::wifi_ap.hpp`
(Phase 7, [roadmap.md](roadmap.md#phase-7--wifi-ap--ota)):

- A checkbox, same convention as the override checkbox above (unfilled =
  off), labeled **"WiFi AP Enabled"**, toggled by SK1 on SKM page 3
  (terse **"AP"** label). Checked by default (the AP comes up
  unconditionally at boot); unchecking it tears down the SoftAP entirely
  — no local web UI/OTA/relay-control reachability at all until it's
  re-enabled from here, since there's no Ethernet fallback wired up yet.
  Not persisted (see below).
- **SSID** — read-only text, `"SSID: AgIsoBlock-XXXX"`.
- **Password** — an Input String, not just a label: its rendered value
  *is* the current password, and it's directly editable from the VT
  (tap-to-edit on a touchscreen, or the VT's own field-navigation on a
  button-only one) rather than needing a separate "edit" key. Confirming
  a new value fires `VTChangeStringValueMessage`
  (`get_vt_change_string_value_event_dispatcher()`), which
  `net::wifi_ap::set_password()` applies immediately (reconfiguring the
  running AP, dropping any already-connected clients including possibly
  whoever just made the change) if it's at least 8 characters — WPA2-PSK's
  actual protocol minimum, not a policy choice — or is rejected and the
  field reverts to the still-current password otherwise. Deliberately no
  default of the "same for every unit" kind (`12345678`, etc. — see
  requirement N7): the device generates a random 12-character password on
  first boot ([roadmap.md](roadmap.md#phase-7--wifi-ap--ota)) and this
  panel is what turns "read it off a serial log once during setup" into
  "read *or change* it from the cab any time," rather than trading that
  security property away for convenience.
- **IP** — read-only text, always `192.168.4.1` (ESP-IDF's fixed
  AP-mode default).
- **Clients** — read-only text, `"Clients: N"`, refreshed roughly every
  2 seconds (`iso::vt_app::refresh_wifi_client_count()`) independently of
  anything the operator does, since it can change on its own (a phone
  joining/leaving the AP).

## Soft Key Masks: three pages, chained via next/back keys

Three Soft Key Mask objects are switched at runtime with the VT's "Change
Soft Key Mask" command (`send_change_softkey_mask`) alongside the main Data
Mask. The channel-name configuration uses a separate Data Mask and its own
back-key mask (see below).

**Page 1 "Main SKM" (10 keys) — the default on connect:**

| Key | Action | Icon |
|---|---|---|
| SK1–SK8 | Toggle relay channel 1–8 | Configured channel name, underlined — same name + underline convention as the AUX-N toggle variant |
| SK9 | Trigger buzzer (momentary pulse) | Text label **"BZ"** — Distinct buzzer/speaker pictogram once icon picking is implemented |
| SK10 | Switch to page 2 | Text label **">>"** |

**Page 2 "Momentary SKM" (10 keys):**

| Key | Action | Icon |
|---|---|---|
| SK1–SK8 | Momentary-override relay channel 1–8 (see [AUX-N functions](#aux-n-functions-17-total) below for exactly what this does) | Configured channel name, plain (no underline) — reuses the same label object as that channel's Data Mask indicator |
| SK9 | Switch back to page 1 | Text label **"<<"** |
| SK10 | Switch to page 3 | Text label **">>"** — reuses page 1's own SK10 label object (identical meaning) |

**Page 3 "WiFi/Settings SKM" (3 keys):**

| Key | Action | Icon |
|---|---|---|
| SK1 | Toggle the WiFi panel's "AP Enabled" checkbox | Text label **"AP"** |
| SK2 | Toggle the "Momentary Override Safety" checkbox | Text label **"OR"** |
| SK3 | Open the channel-name configuration screen | Text label **"CFG"** |
| SK9 | Switch back to page 2 | Text label **"<<"** — reuses page 2's own SK9 label object |

Channel labels use a compact 12×16 font so names up to 8 characters fit in
the same Data Mask and soft-key label widths, including the Data Mask's
additional interlock `!` suffix. Toggle labels remain
underlined; momentary labels remain plain.

## Channel-name configuration

Press **CFG** (SK3 on page 3) to switch to the dedicated configuration Data
Mask. It lists all eight channels as editable Input String fields, with a
back key at SK9 returning to the main Data Mask. The VT's on-screen keyboard
edits each channel directly; clearing a field restores its default `R{n}`
name.

Names are trimmed, restricted to printable ASCII, and limited to 8 characters
so they remain compact on the Data Mask and soft keys. They are stored as
`name1`–`name8` in the NVS `channels` namespace and survive reboot and firmware
updates. The field and all channel labels use the same normalized value.
Changing a name updates the Data Mask, both SK1–SK8 pages, and the toggle and
momentary AUX-N designators at runtime. Toggle labels stay underlined, and a
disabled channel's Data Mask label retains the `!` suffix. A VT that keeps an
old AUX-N assignment-list designator may need its object pool refreshed or a
reconnect; the firmware reapplies saved names after every pool upload/boot.

The "Momentary Override Safety" checkbox is separate from channel
configuration and is **never persisted**; it always remains false at boot.

**Compatibility caveat:** not every VT renders 10 soft keys at once — many
show 6 physical keys per mask, some 8, larger ones more. This needs
resolving on the bench (see [Open questions](#open-questions)) for VTs
other than the one this has actually been tested against — and now
matters more than it did with two pages, since page 1 alone already
assumes the full 10.

## AUX-N functions (17 total)

Each relay channel publishes **two** Auxiliary Function Type 2 objects, so
the operator picks whichever behavior fits their equipment in the
tractor's own native AUX-N assignment menu: a momentary override for
temporarily inverting something, or toggle-and-stay for lights/pumps/fans.
This is a deliberate choice, not an oversight: the hardware is generic
relay contacts that could drive either kind of load, so offering both lets
the assignment-time choice live where it belongs — with the person wiring
up the equipment — at the cost of a longer list in the tractor's
assignment menu.

**The momentary variant is an override, not a direct setter.** An earlier
version mirrored the input value straight to the relay (hold-to-run,
relay on only while held) — but AUX-N input devices report their status
periodically even while idle/released, not just on change, so with a
toggle and a momentary variant both assigned to the same channel, the
momentary variant's own idle "released" reports would repeatedly and
silently stomp whatever the toggle variant had set. Bench-confirmed: "the
momentary always turns it off." Fixed by making momentary an override
instead of a competing setter: pressing it saves the relay's current
state and **inverts** it; releasing restores whatever that saved state
was. So a channel that's latched ON goes OFF while the momentary control
is held and back ON on release — and symmetrically, a channel that's OFF
goes ON while held and back OFF on release. Two controls for the same
relay no longer fight over it, since the momentary one only ever acts
relative to whatever the state already was, never setting an absolute
value of its own.

**Both variants are declared `BooleanNonLatchingIncreaseValue` (2) at the
protocol level — neither uses `BooleanLatchingOnOff` (0).** Most tractors
only expose momentary (spring-return) physical buttons on the
joystick/armrest, and a tractor's own AUX-N assignment menu generally only
offers inputs and functions of matching type — declaring a function as
latching risks it not even showing up as assignable to a real momentary
button (or behaving inconsistently across tractors that are lenient about
the mismatch). So the "latching" *result* one of the two variants
produces is implemented in our own firmware instead of relied on from the
protocol: it toggles the relay on each rising edge of the (declared
momentary) input and ignores the release, rather than mirroring the input
value straight through.

| # | Function | Type 2 `FunctionType` | Behavior | Label/Icon |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1–8 | Relay channel 1–8, toggle | `BooleanNonLatchingIncreaseValue` (2) | Firmware toggles the relay on each press (rising edge), ignores release — a momentary button acts like a latch | Configured channel name, **underlined** |
| 9–16 | Relay channel 1–8, momentary override | `BooleanNonLatchingIncreaseValue` (2) | Firmware saves the relay's current state and inverts it on press; restores the saved state on release — see the note above | Configured channel name, plain (no underline) — reuses the same label object as that channel's Data Mask indicator, and shared with the same-numbered key on SKM page 2 |
| 17 | Buzzer | `BooleanNonLatchingIncreaseValue` (2) | Edge-triggered pulse on rising edge; matches SK9's pulse behavior | Own dedicated **"BZ"** label |

See `handle_aux_function_event` in
[vt_app.cpp](../firmware/main/isobus/vt_app.cpp) for the actual edge
detection / override logic.

All 17 are advertised unconditionally; whether any physical joystick/armrest
button actually gets mapped to one is entirely up to the tractor's own
native AUX-N assignment menu (see [isobus-protocol.md](isobus-protocol.md#auxiliary-control--aux-n-iso-11783-6-annex--iso-11783-7)).
Our only job is to publish 17 distinctly-iconed, correctly-typed functions.

**Type 2, not Type 1:** AgIsoStack++'s own object-pool parser
(`isobus_virtual_terminal_working_set_base.cpp`) logs that
`AuxiliaryFunctionType1` objects are "parsed and validated but NOT
utilized by version 3 or later VTs in making Auxiliary Control
Assignments" — confirmed relevant here since the bench VT reports a
version well into that range. `AuxiliaryFunctionType2` (ISO 11783-6:2018)
is the one that actually works on modern terminals, so that's what's
implemented, even though every example in the vendored library still only
demonstrates the (deprecated-for-this-purpose) Type 1 path.

## Icon design guidelines

- **Format:** monochrome (1-bit) Picture Graphics for broadest VT
  compatibility. A colour variant can be layered on top later for VTs that
  support it, but must stay legible in black & white — colour is
  decoration here, never the only signal (per the "black and white or
  simple colours" brief).
- **Sizes:** ISO 11783-6 defines soft-key icon sizes per VT size class.
  The text-label pass that stands in for icons today reads at 32×32 (up
  from an initial 8×8 that was found to be "way too small" on the bench)
  and the Data Mask indicators are 60×60 — design the actual icon bitmaps
  against those, with a 24×24 fallback for VTs too small to fit them, and
  48×48 variants for larger/newer VTs if the pool format supports
  multiple sizes.
- **Relay icon:** one shared pictogram (simple toggle-switch/relay-coil
  symbol) reused for channels 1–8, distinguished by an overlaid or
  adjacent channel number ("1".."8") — R1..R8 read as *one set*,
  distinguished by number, not by 8 unrelated pictograms.
- **Buzzer icon:** a simple speaker/bell pictogram, visually distinct in
  silhouette from the relay icon at a glance (different action type:
  momentary signal vs. persistent switch), not just distinguished by a
  missing number.
- Actual bitmap artwork is a follow-up implementation task (Phase 3/4) —
  this section is the spec an icon author/tool needs to satisfy, not the
  pixels themselves.

## Interaction / precedence rules

- Three input paths can change a relay's state: Data Mask tap (if the
  touch-toggle enhancement is built), SKM key press, and an AUX-N-mapped
  joystick/armrest button. All three ultimately call the same
  `relay_driver::set_relay(channel, state)` (see
  [architecture.md](architecture.md)) — there's exactly one source of
  truth for relay state, no separate "VT state" vs "AUX-N state".
- Last action wins; no input path is more authoritative than another —
  matches requirement F11 (manual control always able to reclaim an
  automation-driven output).
- SK9/buzzer AUX function is a **momentary pulse**, not a toggle: pressing
  it fires a fixed-duration buzzer pulse; it never reports a "stuck on"
  state back to the VT/AUX-N side.

## Open questions

- [ ] Confirm target VTs' actual soft key counts (6 vs 8 vs more) before
      finalizing whether all 9 keys fit on one SKM or need a second page.
- [ ] Confirm AgIsoStack++'s actual Auxiliary Function "type" enum names
      for latching vs. momentary boolean functions (placeholder terms
      "latching"/"non-latching" used above pending a look at the library API).
- [ ] Decide whether Data Mask indicators are touch-toggleable Button
      objects or read-only Output Rectangles (depends on target VT
      hardware; read-only is the safe default, touch is an enhancement).
- [ ] Produce actual Picture Graphic bitmaps (one shared relay pictogram +
      one buzzer pictogram) once the guidelines above are agreed.
- [ ] Decide object pool versioning/hash strategy so we can tell whether a
      VT already has our current pool cached (see
      [isobus-protocol.md](isobus-protocol.md)).
