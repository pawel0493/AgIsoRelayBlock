# AgIsoRelayBlock

An open-source, DIY-friendly alternative to commercial ISOBUS relay boxes
(e.g. [ISOBUS Block](https://isobusblock.com/)), built on the off-the-shelf
**Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH-8DI-8RO-C** industrial relay module.

> Status: **Early firmware, bench-verified through Phase 4, the start of
> Phase 6, Phase 7, and the start of Phase 8.** The device claims an
> ISOBUS address, uploads a three-page Virtual Terminal object pool, its
> on-screen soft keys and AUX-N joystick/armrest functions actually
> switch real relays, a digital input can act as a limit-switch interlock
> for its matching channel, it brings up its own WiFi AP with a local
> status/control page and OTA firmware updates (SSID/password/status also
> shown and editable right on the VT), and it now broadcasts DM1
> diagnostics for the fault conditions it can actually detect -- see
> [Project Status](#project-status) below.

## Why

ISOBUS terminals in modern tractors (John Deere, Fendt, Valtra, Case IH,
CLAAS, ...) already provide a screen and AUX-N joystick/armrest buttons.
Most older or 3rd-party implements only have a dumb toggle-switch box, so
every implement needs its own unlabeled switches and the tractor's built-in
controls go unused.

Commercial products like ISOBUS Block solve this with a small relay ECU that
plugs into the tractor's ISOBUS (ISO 11783) connector: outputs are named,
given icons, and mapped to any AUX-N joystick button or the Virtual Terminal
screen, with a couple of onboard inputs available for simple automations.

**Goal of this project:** reproduce that functionality as open-source
firmware for cheap, widely-available industrial ESP32 relay hardware, so
anyone can build or modify their own ISOBUS relay/input block.

## Target hardware

[Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH-8DI-8RO-C](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-eth-8di-8ro-c.htm)
("C" = CAN variant), an industrial DIN-rail module built around an
ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U-N16R8:

> **This board ships in several look-alike variants — only the "-C" (CAN)
> one works for ISOBUS.** Waveshare also sells an `ESP32-S3-ETH-8DI-8RO`
> (no "C") with **RS485 instead of CAN**, and a PoE Ethernet variant
> (`ESP32-S3-POE-ETH-8DI-8RO-C`, still CAN, still fine). When buying, check
> for the CAN transceiver + screw terminal and the "-C" suffix — see
> [docs/hardware.md#variants](docs/hardware.md#variants).

- 8x relay outputs (≤10 A @ 250 VAC / 30 VDC, 1NO+1NC, optocoupler isolated)
- 8x digital inputs (5–36 V, passive/active, bi-directional optocoupler isolated)
- Onboard **isolated CAN transceiver** (this is our ISOBUS physical layer),
  with a jumper-selectable 120 Ω termination resistor
- W5500 10/100 Ethernet + WiFi/BLE (used for config/OTA/diagnostics, not for ISOBUS)
- USB-C (power, flashing, debug), RTC, buzzer, WS2812 RGB status LED, TF
  card slot, screw terminals, DIN-rail ABS enclosure
- 7–36 V DC screw-terminal power input (12 V/24 V tractor electrics compatible)

## Feature checklist (parity target vs. ISOBUS Block)

| Feature | ISOBUS Block | AgIsoRelayBlock plan |
|---|---|---|
| ISO 11783 ECU, address claim | Yes | Yes ([docs/isobus-protocol.md](docs/isobus-protocol.md)) |
| Shows up on tractor's Virtual Terminal | Yes | Yes (VT client + object pool, see [docs/vt-ui-design.md](docs/vt-ui-design.md)) |
| Name each channel, pick an icon, from the terminal | Yes | Yes (VT input objects, no PC/app needed) |
| Assign any channel to a joystick/armrest button (AUX-N) | Yes | Yes (17 AUX-N functions: 8 relays × toggle+momentary variants + buzzer) |
| Sensor input → automatic relay control, configured on-screen | Yes (8ch model) | Yes (rule engine, VT-configurable) |
| Runs on 12 V / 24 V tractor power | Yes | Yes (board supports 7–36 V) |
| Industrial isolation (opto + power) | Yes | Yes (board provides this in hardware) |
| Channel count | 8 or 32 | 8 (matches this board); more via CAN-connected expansion later |
| Firmware updates | Vendor-managed | Self-hosted OTA over always-on WiFi AP (`AgIsoBlock-XXXX`) and/or Ethernet |
| OEM/private label, warranty, support | Commercial | Not applicable (open source, no warranty) |

See [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md) for the detailed functional
and non-functional requirements this maps to.

## Planned architecture (short version)

- **Framework:** ESP-IDF (native), C++17.
- **ISOBUS/J1939 stack:** [AgIsoStack++](https://github.com/Open-Agriculture/AgIsoStack-plus-plus)
  (MIT-licensed, has a built-in ESP32 **TWAI** hardware driver, VT client,
  and AUX-N support already implemented — avoids re-implementing ISO 11783
  from scratch).
- **CAN:** ESP32-S3 built-in TWAI controller → onboard isolated CAN
  transceiver → ISOBUS connector (250 kbit/s, 29-bit extended ID).
- **I/O:** thin driver layer mapping AgIsoStack++ output/input requests to
  the board's relay and digital-input GPIOs.
- **Config storage:** channel names/icons, AUX-N assignments and automation
  rules persisted in NVS flash.
- **WiFi:** always-on SoftAP named `AgIsoBlock-XXXX` (XXXX = last 2 bytes
  of the device's MAC, hex), used for OTA updates and local config — never
  for ISOBUS traffic.
- **Ethernet (W5500):** not part of the ISOBUS link; an alternate path for
  the same local web UI, logging, and OTA updates.

## Project status

Bench-verified through Phase 4 (plus the first slice of Phase 6) of
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) on real hardware (see
[firmware/README.md](firmware/README.md) for the full detail and
bug-fix history):

1. ~~Pin down exact GPIO mapping~~ — done, and corrected a real error in
   Waveshare's own diagram (I²C SDA/SCL were swapped) along the way.
2. ~~Get AgIsoStack++ building for ESP32-S3 (TWAI driver) with a "hello
   ISOBUS" address-claim-only example.~~ — done; claims a real address
   against a live bus in ~350ms, now stable across reboots too.
3. ~~Minimal VT object pool: 8 on/off indicators, no naming yet.~~ — done;
   hand-encoded (no external pool designer tool used) and confirmed
   rendering correctly on a real VT.
4. ~~Wire relay/DI GPIOs into the stack.~~ — done: relays are driven by
   three Soft Key Mask pages and 17 AUX-N functions; all 8 digital inputs
   are debounced and each shown on screen next to its channel.
5. ~~AUX-N support.~~ — done: 17 Auxiliary Function Type 2 objects (a
   toggle + a momentary-invert-and-restore variant per relay channel, plus
   a momentary buzzer trigger), confirmed rendering and driving relays on
   a real VT.
6. ~~On-screen channel naming + persistence.~~ — done: use the VT's CFG
   screen to rename all eight channels, with names retained in NVS across
   reboot and firmware updates. Icon picking remains deferred; it needs
   Picture Graphics artwork and grows the object pool / upload time.
7. Input → output automation rules — **started**: the first, concrete use
   case (digital input DI{n} as a limit-switch interlock forcing relay
   channel {n} off) is done, plus a "Momentary Override Safety" checkbox
   letting an operator deliberately bypass it with a momentary button/key
   when they need to; a general VT-configurable rule schema is not.
8. ~~WiFi AP (`AgIsoBlock-XXXX`) + OTA update path.~~ — done: always-on
   SoftAP with a randomly-generated, NVS-persisted password, and a local
   web page (status + relay toggles mirroring the VT, plus a firmware
   upload form) with rollback if the new image fails to claim its ISOBUS
   address. SSID/password/status are also shown (and the password is
   editable) right on the VT itself.

9. Polish, ~~diagnostics (DM1).~~ — DM1 done: broadcasts Active Diagnostic
   Trouble Codes for VT-connection-lost and relay-I2C-write-failure, the
   two conditions this hardware can actually detect right now (CAN
   bus-off monitoring and physical relay-state feedback are still open).
   General polish is not.

Known open issues: the tractor's soft key labels sometimes don't visually
refresh when switching between SKM pages until another key is pressed,
even though the underlying page switch takes effect immediately (reads
as a VT-side repaint quirk, not a firmware bug -- the switch
command is confirmed sent and the new page's keys already respond
correctly); the implement sometimes disappears from the VT and needs a VT
restart (traced to a likely gap in AgIsoStack++'s own vendored VT server
reference implementation, not this firmware -- see
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md#phase-3--minimal-vt-presence)).
